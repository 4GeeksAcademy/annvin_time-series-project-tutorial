**American Express Default Prediction**

This will be a very exciting project because we will enroll in a Kaggle competition! This time you will not only deliver a solution link for the bootcamp, you will also be able to win cash prizes and increase your possiblities to be seen by a huge company, in this case, American Express!

Let's go step by step on how to do this project:

**Step 1:**

If you don't have it yet, create an account in kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/)

**Step 2:**

Go to the following link https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amex-default-prediction .

This is an amazing real time competition launched by American Express on default prediction. The purpose is to predict if a customer will default in the future.

Read the Overview information about the description of the problem, the evaluation metrics, the timeline and the prizes. Once you get an overview of the competition, you can click on the button "Join the competition" and accept the terms. Now you are in!

As you can see, the deadline to submit the prediction results is August 24th, 2022.

Also, you may have noticed the prizes which go from $40,000 to the 1st place in the leaderboard to $10,000 for the 4th place in the leaderboard. In addition to cash prizes to the top winners, American Express is hiring!

Highly ranked contestants who indicate their interest will be considered by American Express for interviews.


**Step 3:**

There is no need to repeat the work. Use Kaggle notebooks, submit your results to Kaggle, check your position on the leaderboard and then download your finished notebook to add it to your Project repo in Github.

>Don't forget in Github to follow the structure you already know by adding your pipelines to the app.py file and saving the final model in the 'models' folder.

**Step 4:**

In the course, add the link to your Kaggle competition submitted notebook.
> Feel free to keep improving your score and position in the competition until the deadline date.
